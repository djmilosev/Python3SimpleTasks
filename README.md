# Python 3

Practicing Python3 scripting for System Engineers.

## Setting up Python 3

  - Setting up a Cloud Server Development Environment
  - Installing Python 3 on CentOS 7
  - Introducing the REPL for Rapid Experimentation

## Common Data Types

  - Strings
  - Numbers
  - Booleans
  - Variables
  - Lists
  - Tuples
  - Dictionaries

## Control Flow 

  - Conditionals and Comparisons
  - The "while" loop
  - The "for" loop
  - Logic operations


## Scripting with Python 3

  - Basic scripting (reading user input, functions basics, using functions in scripts, using standard library packages, working with ENVVARs etc)
  - Intermediate scripting (parsing command line params, Robust CLIs with 'argparse', Handling Errors with try/except/else/finally, Exit Statuses, Execute Shell Commands from Python)
  - Useful Standard Library Packages (random & json, shutil & glob, re & math)

## Third-Party Packages 

  - Using Pip and Virtualenv (installing 3rd party packages using pip, virtualenv, using 3rd party packages in your scripts)

## Creating a Larger Scripting Project 

  - Planning & Project Structure 
  - Implementing Features with Test Driven Development 
  - Integrating Features and Distributing the Project
